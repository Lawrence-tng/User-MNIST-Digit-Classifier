# User-MNIST-Digit-Classifier
Trains Sequential Model Using MNIST Digit Database, then uses model to classify user drawn digits

 Please install the neccesary tools:
 https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual
 
 
Setting up TenserFlow:

1. Once Anaconda is installed, set up new enviroment with python packages

2. In Anaconda Navigator, install TenserFlow packages

3. Set MNIST Digit Classification.py's Python interpreter to the Python in the newly created enviroment

Run MNIST Digit Classification.py

Once model has finished training and UI will pop up 

Draw digit on UI and press save

Then a Matplotlib window will show the drawn digit as a MNIST-like Digit along with the predicted classification!
